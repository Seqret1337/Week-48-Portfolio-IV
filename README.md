# Week-48-Portfolio-IV

functionalities added:

** The starting level has an empty slot in the surrounding wall. This slot should function as a door into the level called "aSharpPlace." Implement the door functionality so that the player can proceed to the next level.
** Create a new level (a third level) and link the unused door in "aSharpPlace" to exit into the new room.
** In "aSharpPlace," implement teleport functionality for the "♨︎" symbols. Entering one should move the player to the other.
** Ensure that when going back through a door, the player returns to the correct room.
** Make the X NPC characters perform a simple patrol (+/-2 from their starting locations).
